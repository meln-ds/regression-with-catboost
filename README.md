Car Price Prediction with CatBoost

This is a tutorial on how to solve a regression problem using CatBoost, as part of IHSMarkit's Car Price Prediction Kaggle Challenge.

The notebook is built to allow trying out different regression algorithms, but I eventually went for CatBoost. Feedback and suggestions most welcome!
